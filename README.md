## Lorem
When working with RNA-seq data, several tools exist to quantify differences in splicing across conditions and to address the significance of those changes (e.g. [DEXSeq](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html)). Quiet often though, these tools result in a long list of genes that is difficult to interpret. By relying on transcript level quantifications, **Lorem** provides a simple (yet powerful) approach to identify, annotate and visualise the most extreme changes in splicing across two different conditions, namely **switch events**. In brief, switch events are defined as those cases where, for a given gene, the identity of the most abundant transcript changes across conditions:
